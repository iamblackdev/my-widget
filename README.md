# Getting Started Support Widget

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

Create a div with an id="my-widget" and data-email="yoursupport@email.com". You can also pass an optional primary color data-primary_color="colorcode"

```
<div id="my-widget" data-email="yoursupport@email.com" data-primary_color="colorcode"></div>
```

You also need to add this css and javascript file to the buttom of your web page close to the body tag.

```
<link href="https://supportwidget.vercel.app/index.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="https://supportwidget.vercel.app/"></script>
```
